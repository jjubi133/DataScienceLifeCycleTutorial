# DataScienceLifeCycleTutorial
Suicide Rates Across States

The purpose of this tutorial is to provide a relevant example to guide readers through the data science lifecycle. 
The data science lifecycle is comprised of 5 stages: Data Collection, Data Processing, Exploratory Analysis and Data 
Visualization, Model Analysis, and Interpretation. In this tutorial, we will navigate through all 5 stages to demonstrate
how data scientists draw conclusions from messy and seemingly unrelated data sets. Understanding what factors into suicide 
is extremely important for saving lives. Data science can allow for a better understanding of the risk of suicide and what can 
be done moving forward for more effective prevention. This tutorial demonstrates how data science can be applied to help 
provide insight into serious matters with results that can be used to make effective changes to make a positive change.
